* php-styles.el

  PHP mode does not provide an easy way to switch to a different coding style,
  which makes it a pain to edit multiple files in different types of projects in
  a single Emacs session. This package provide some helper functions to do it.

** Usage

   To enable this package, add the =php-styles-php-mode-config= function to
   =php-mode-hook= :

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-hook 'php-mode-hook 'php-styles-mode-config)
#+end_src

   You will then be able to use the =php-switch-to-psr-2=,
   =php-styles-switch-to-wordpress= and =php-styles-switch-to-spip= commands.

   We will try to guess the coding style by searching for a common file. You can
   disable this feature using the =php-style-guess= customizable variable.
